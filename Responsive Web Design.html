            Almost everyone wants a mobile version of their website. It’s practically essential after all. If you want to browse the web or check some website what device do you use? Mobile Phones or tablets! This is where responsiveness comes. When someone says responsive design it means that the website’s layout fits the resolution of the screen perfectly.
            Responsive web design is a method in which both design and development can adapt to user based screen size and orientation so that they can get good optimal experience no matter what screen they are using. It eliminates the need to zoom in in order to see the content and content is not left distorted or cropped. Instead, it is aligned perfectly with the screen.

<div class="container-centre">
    <p>
        Since we use touches and swipes to interact with our mobile devices, A website that is easy to navigate like primary option being on the  bottom as thumbs don’t reach top of the screens comfortably, Also adding interactive elements to the center of screen as it is harder to get to sides and corners of mobile screens.

<div class="container-centre ">
    <h3>
        Landscape orientation
    </h3>
    <p>
        While using landscape orientation , navigation is good as both the thumbs can be used .But scrolling becomes harder which could cause a problem as users have to scroll more in landscape mode.
