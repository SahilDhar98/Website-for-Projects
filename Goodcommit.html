            Thinking of a good commits is one of the most tedious task a developer has to do . Sometimes it can feel counterproductive too.
            But learning to write a good commit goes a long way and keeps one organised as it is better to put 2 extra minutes in today than having to scratch your head 6 months down the line trying to understand what you did.

    <h2>What is a Commit?</h2>

<div class="container-centre">
    <p>
        They are the simplest building block of Source Control history.
        Healthy Commits leads to maintainable codes and the projects become much easier to develop. 
        A Commit constitutes what changes have been done to the code.
        It should explain any configurations changed; APIs introduced etc.
        Even if some non-technical person is going to read the commit message, he/she should be able to understand what the code changes are and how can they impact the code.
        It also helps QA understanding what they will be reviewing.
